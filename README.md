# VolumeSelect
Volume Select is a Blender 4.5 addon that allows you to select loose mesh components (vertices, edges, or faces) based on their bounding-box volumes. Instead of manually finding small or large disconnected parts, you can define multiple threshold ranges to automatically select all components that fit any range.
